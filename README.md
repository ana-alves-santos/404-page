# ðŸš€ 404 Page - Lost in Space

Simple 404 page with a space theme using HTML and CSS.

## ðŸŽ¨ What I learned with CSS

- Centering content with Flexbox.  
- Creating animations with `@keyframes` (blinking stars, rotating astronaut, floating effect).  
- Using absolute positioning for background stars.  
- Making a radial gradient background.  
- Styling buttons and links with colors, rounded corners, and hover effects.  
- Applying text shadows for better visual impact.
